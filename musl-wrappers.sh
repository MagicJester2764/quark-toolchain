#
# The include order is musl's, then the compiler's own, then Quark's platform
# headers. -nostdinc removes all three, so each has to be put back, and the
# middle one is the easy one to forget: \`include%s\` is gcc's private directory,
# which holds the intrinsics (xmmintrin.h, cpuid.h), stdatomic.h and the rest of
# what the compiler supplies rather than the C library. musl-gcc on Linux lists
# it in exactly this position. Without it every program using SSE intrinsics or
# C11 atomics fails to compile, which pixman's test suite was the first to do.
# musl comes first so that its stddef.h and friends win over gcc's.
