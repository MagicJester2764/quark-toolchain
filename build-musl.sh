# Build musl for Quark.

#     ./build-musl.sh /path/to/musl-1.2.5
#
# Needs the x86_64-quark toolchain on PATH (build.sh) and the translation
# layer built (`make -C ../quarkutils/linux-abi`).
#
# musl is written against Linux — not against "a kernel", but against Linux's
# numbers, argument order, error convention and idea of what a process is.
# Quark's calls are a different set with different semantics, so this is a
# translation layer rather than a port, and the layer lives in Quark's tree
# where it can talk to the servers that actually answer most of it.
#
# The patch is seven files and no more, which is the interesting part: musl's
# system call interface really is that narrow. Four of them are about issuing a
# system call at all. The other three are the places musl asks the kernel for
# something Quark does not have the shape of, each of which becomes a tail
# call into the translation layer: `clone`, where Linux has the child *return
# from the same call* on a new stack and Quark starts a task at an entry
# point; `vfork`, where the child returns through a stack it has borrowed; and
# the end of a detached thread, which unmaps the stack it is standing on.
